      :description: The Splunk HEC receiver allows the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector to collect logs and metrics in Splunk HTTP Event Collector format.

The Splunk HTTP Event Collector (HEC) receiver allows the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector to collect events and logs in Splunk HEC format. The supported pipeline types are ``metrics`` and ``logs``. See :ref:`otel-data-processing` for more information.

The receiver accepts data formatted as JSON HEC events under any path or as end-of-line separated log raw data if sent to the ``raw_path``. See :new-page:`Format events for HTTP Event Collector <https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Data/FormateventsforHTTPEventCollector>` for more information.

.. note:: For information about the HEC exporter, see :ref:`splunk-hec-exporter`.

Get started
======================

Follow these steps to configure and activate the component:

1. Deploy the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector to your host or container platform:
   
   - :ref:`otel-install-linux`
   - :ref:`otel-install-windows`
   - :ref:`otel-install-k8s`

2. Configure the Splunk HEC receiver as described in the next section.
3. Restart the Collector.

Sample configurations
----------------------

To activate the Splunk HEC receiver add a ``splunk_hec`` entry inside the ``receivers`` section of the Collector configuration file. For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   exporters:
      splunk_hec:

The following example shows a Splunk HEC receiver configured with all available settings:

.. code-block:: yaml

   exporters:
     # ...
     splunk_hec:
     # Address and port the Splunk HEC receiver should bind to
     endpoint: localhost:8088
     # Whether to preserve incoming access token
     access_token_passthrough: true
     # Path accepting raw HEC events (logs only)
     raw_path: "/foo"
     # Path reporting health checks
     health_path: "/bar"
     # Define field mappings
     hec_metadata_to_otel_attrs:
       source: "file.name"
       sourcetype: "foobar"
       index: "myindex"
       host: "myhostfield"
     # Optional TLS settings
     tls:
       # Both cert_file and
       # key_file are required
       # for TLS connections
       cert_file: /test.crt
       key_file: /test.key
