The Databricks receiver allows the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector to collect metrics from Databricks using the Databricks API. Use this integration to view and monitor the health of your Databricks clusters. The supported pipeline type is ``metrics``.

Benefits
===============================

After you configure the integration, you can access the following features:

- Visualize physical servers, virtual machines, AWS instances, and other resources in your environment that are visible to Splunk Observability Cloud. For information about navigators, see :ref:`use-navigators-imm`.

- Search for metrics sent by the receiver. For information about Metric Finder, see :ref:`metrics-finder-and-metadata-catalog`.

Get started
======================

Follow these steps to configure and activate the component:

1. Deploy the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector to your host or container platform:
   
   - :ref:`otel-install-linux`
   - :ref:`otel-install-windows`
   - :ref:`otel-install-k8s`

2. Configure the Databricks receiver as described in the next section.
3. Restart the Collector.

Sample configurations
----------------------

To activate the Databricks receiver, add ``databricks`` to the ``receivers`` section of your
configuration file with all the mandatory fields, as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: yaml

  receivers:
    databricks:
      instance_name: my-instance
      endpoint: https://my.host
      token: abc123
      collection_interval: 60s
      max_results: 10

To complete the configuration, include the receiver in the ``metrics`` pipeline of the ``service`` section of your
configuration file. For example:

.. code:: yaml

   service:
     pipelines:
       metrics:
         receivers: [databricks]

   * - ``token``
     - An access token to authenticate to the Databricks API. See :new-page:`Authentication using Databricks personal access tokens <https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/authentication.html>` on the Databricks documentation site for more information. 
     - Yes
   * - ``collection_interval``
     -  How often this receiver fetches information from the Databricks API. Must be a string readable by ``time.ParseDuration``. The default value is ``30s``.
     -  No
   * -  ``max_results``
     - The maximum number of items to return per API call. The default value is ``25``, which is the maximum value. If set explicitly, the API requires a value greater than ``0``, and less than or equal to ``25``.
